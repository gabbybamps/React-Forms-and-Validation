This simple React App is about Forms. It allows users to enter their 'Firstname', 'Lastname' and 'Email address' which are then verified. If any of the entries is invalid, the user is alerted and the 'submit' button would not be enabled.
Concepts in use include: Custom hooks, React Hooks and Form validity.
